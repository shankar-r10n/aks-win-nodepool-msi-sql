# .NET 4.7 ASP.Net MVC App on AKS Windows Node Pool + Azure SQL DB + User-assigned managed identity  

This repo provides the prerequisites, setup instructions and a sample .NET 4.7.2 ASP.NET MVC App for testing Azure SQL DB connectivity utilizing User-Assigned Managed Identities on AKS cluster with a Windows node pool.

## Premise

The assignment of a user-assigned managed idenity (uMI) to a Windows Node pool and creating a DB user for the uMI in a Azure SQL DB (say AlphaDB) - should ensure that an app hosted on the Windows node pool **can connect** to the Alpha DB. 

And it should also ensure that the  same app **cannot connect** to another DB (say Gamma DB) in the same Azure SQL Logical server which **does not** have the DB user created for the uMI.

## :memo: Prerequisites
- AKS Cluster for Windows Nodes (running an actively supported Kubernetes version.) This setup cluster has been tested with Kubernetes v 1.17.11
- A Windows node pool in the AKS cluster.
- Container registry (like Azure Container Registry for storing / managing the sample app image.)
- 2 Azure SQL DBs (*say [AlphaDB] and [GammaDB] *) in an Azure SQL server.


## Setup Instructions

1.	Create an user-assigned managed identity.
```
az identity create -g <RESOURCE GROUP> -n <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME>
```
2.	Assign the created identity to the Windows node pool VMSS in respective **MC_** resource group of the AKS cluster.
```
az vmss identity assign -g <RESOURCE GROUP>
-n <VIRTUAL MACHINE SCALE SET NAME>
--identities <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY>
```
3. As an AAD admin for the Azure SQL server,  create a user in Azure SQL DB – [Alpha DB]– for the newly created managed identity.
```
CREATE USER [<identity-name>] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER
```

4.	In the sample app - NPTester - `HomeController.cs` file provide the needed - `serverName`, `databaseName`, `clientId`  and connection string details in the requiste sections of the sample  .NET  application.
5.	Build/push to container registry and deploy the app to the AKS Cluster.
> A sample yaml file - winnp.yaml - is provided in the repo for deploying the app and creating a backing service.
6.	Launch the app and verify that connection to Alpha DB is successful.
7.	Verify that connection to Gamma DB is NOT successful.


## Result

The app  should reflect similar to following image - depicting ability to connect to Alpha DB. And unsuccessful connnection to GammaDB.
